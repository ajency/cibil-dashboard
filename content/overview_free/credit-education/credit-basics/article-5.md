**My loan has been rejected because of the defaults reported against my name in CIBIL records. How do I remove my name from the CIBIL's defaulters list?**

CIBIL maintains the credit history of individuals as reported by lenders. The decision to grant a loan is solely dependent on the lender's credit policy. Monitor your CIBIL Score and Report regularly and ensure you have a high score so that you are loan-ready when the need arises. It is also important to review your report and identify any possible discrepancies / errors that might be reflecting against your name, and could be responsible for pulling down your score.

**What kind of inaccuracies can reflect on my CIBIL report?**

Your CIBIL Report includes your details and information as reported by lenders to CIBIL. In case of any inaccurate details reflecting in your CIBIL Report, you are requested to raise a dispute and highlight this to us. We will then reach out to the relevant lender and check these details.

**Ownership:**

If either some of the personal details or one or more accounts / enquiries on your CIBIL Report do not belong to you.

**Incorrect personal details:**

Lenders submit details of your credit account along with your personal / contact / employment information such as name, address, date of birth, PAN, telephone number, income etc. CIBIL then creates your complete credit profile based on these details. Hence, it is important to update your lender every time there is a change in the information as incorrect details may lead to a wrong CIBIL Report being generated.

**Inaccurate account details:**

Lenders generally submit data to CIBIL within a span of 30 - 45 days and if you happen to access your CIBIL Report within 45 days of your last payment of dues, it may not be updated. This leads to reflection of inaccurate current balance or amount overdue in your CIBIL Report. However, if the 'Date Reported' (date on which data is submitted by that lender) associated with that account is older than 2 months, and the payment made is still not reflecting, you can raise a dispute.
