See your Personalized Loan Offers Typically when we need a loan or a credit card, we approach at least 2-3 banks or financial institutions to find out interest rates and the other charges (such as processing charges). We then get all our documents in place and submit them to these lenders along with the loan application. Lenders now begin the &amp;lsquo;Loan evaluation&amp;rsquo; process by first referring your CIBIL Score and Report while assessing your application.</description>

So, what exactly does your CIBIL report contain? We are all familiar with the fear and anxiety that we feel when applying for a loan. After all, it&amp;rsquo;s the lender who decides whether we can own our dream home, our first car, or whether our children can pursue higher education. In a nutshell, a better life depends on the lender&amp;rsquo;s decision.
We are unsure of the lender&amp;rsquo;s criteria to evaluate our application.</description>

      <description>Myths and Facts
MYTH- CIBIL maintains list of defaulters only and having your name in CIBIL is bad.
FACT- If you have ever taken a loan or credit card from any bank or financial institution then your information is most likely with CIBIL. So your name will be with CIBIL even if you are paying all your obligations on time. RBI has mandated banks and financial institutions to submit monthly repayment data pertaining to those customers who have taken a loan or credit card with them to a Credit Bureau.</description>
